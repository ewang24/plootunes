This project uses Angular 15 and Electron 23.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` to run the angular source code in dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Then, run `electron` to spin up the electron app. It will open an electron window that will display the angular app contents. It will also reload automatically if you change the source.
